    "Consumer complaint narrative": "I 'm a longtime member of Charter One Bank/RBS Citizens Bank. When my mother ; XXXX XXXX became elderly, I assisted her in opening an account with Charter One at their branch office located on XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX in XXXX, Michigan and I was placed on her account as co-account owner. As my mother 's XXXX, it became necessary for me to obtain a \" Durable Power of Attorney '' to handle both her Financial and Medical needs. Some years ago, with my mother present, I presented the original ( stamped with seal ) \" Durable Power of Attorney '' at the Charter One branch office located on XXXX in XXXX, Michigan for their record file. When presented, it was my understanding I would be placed on all of my mother 's account. Furthermore, when I needed to transact her business I would be welcomed as though \" I '' were \" She. '' On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I was contacted by Charter One Master Card someone had made fraudulent charges on my mother 's credit card account. The caller stated she would immediately close my mother 's Master Credit Card account and open a new account and send another Master Card the next day. Upon receiving my mother 's new credit card I realized she was entitled to \" XXXX '' bonus points. I telephoned the bank to redeem her \" XXXX XXXX '' bonus points and I was informed my name was not on my mother 's credit card account. I informed them, I had taken the original \" Durable Power of Attorney '' into the branch office and it should be on file. The representative indicated there was a \" Durable Power of Attorney '' on file with Charter One Bank but Master Card is a separate entity from the bank and would require another \" Durable Power of Attorney. '' I replied why ca n't Charter One forward a copy of the \" Durable Power of Attorney '' to Master Card. I was told to go into a local branch and they could resolve the issue. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I went into the Charter One Bank located ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, Michigan, XXXX. I was told no branch manager was available - the bank teller made copies of \" Durable Power of Attorney '' and stated she would forward the document to the branch manager the following day to resolve the issue. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I telephoned the XXXX branch for the results of their investigation and was told by an individual who identified himself as : XXXX, there were no branch managers available, but he had talked to representatives at banking headquarters and I would have to telephone \" customer service '' along with my mother on the telephone to resolve the issue. I informed him my mother is XXXX ( XXXX ) years old and suffers from \" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and is XXXX of the issues involved. He offered a XXXX suggestion was to take the original \" Durable Power of Attorney '' into a local branch office for recording and to be placed on file. I indicated to him I had already done that years ago at the XXXX branch. XXXX indicated he was unable to resolve the matter at his level. In an effort to resolve the issue without further problems, on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I went to the branch office ; XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Michigan, XXXX and talked to XXXX XXXX. She indicated there was \" no '' branch manager available but she would assist me. She telephoned bank headquarters who told her there was \" no '' \" Durable Power of Attorney '' on file on my mother 's account. There are inconsistencies in the responses I received while trying to resolve this issue with Charter One Bank. I know I took the original \" Durable Power of Attorney '' to the Charter One Bank in XXXX, Michigan XXXX years ago to be placed on file for my mother 's banking accounts. This level of \" customer service '' is abysmal.",

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "I opened a credit card account with Macys in XX/XX/XXXX. The sales associate put my old mailing address from my license which I did not notice at that time because he did not ask this question of my current mailing address. I wait for my card to arrive in the mail for a month but I do n't get one. So I decided to give a call to their customer service number. I mentioned to the representative that I do n't have the card with me, but I like to make the payment and I confirmed my identity as was asked by the representative. she insisted that she ca n't take the payment till I have the card with me, so I reasoned that since I do n't have the card and I do n't know my payment due date, I will be late on making payment and then you guys will charge me late fee. she was not willing to tell me my due date, but agreed to take the payment after talking to some other person. after while she says the payment processing system is down and I should call back to make the payment. I call back in a couple of days again to make the payment and I am told that it is late now. I told them that the other day another representative was n't willing to take my payment and was n't willing to tell my due date, so how can I make the payment on time? After another month, I call back to make another payment and I repeat the same thing that I still have not received my card yet, but would like to make a payment and not sure if I am late on making payment. This time the representative tells me that I have missed the due date. She offers to verify my mailing address and then I tell her if my old address is on record. she tells me that this is the case of old address on record. she tells me that she will go ahead and update mailing address and send me a new card to that address and also wave the late fee because it was n't my fault. She told me not to worry about late fee being charged. I receive my card this month and I log into my account to find out that I am charged late fee in the last two months, so I decide to give them call again. This time the representative tells me that what do I want him to do even after explaining all the situation. when I ask him to reimburse my late fees because it was not my fault and I did my part to reach out every time. he says everything is being documented, but he can only reimburse {$18.00}. I said how is that possible since I was not at fault and I was assured of not being charged late fee. And when I tried to make the payment on time, the representative tells that their system is down. so I feel that they are using the deceptive practices of charging customers late fees under the pretext wrong policy of not sharing the due date even after verifying their identity and not taking the payment before due date so they can put the blame on the customers after the due date is passed. I am sure I will be vindicated if their recorded calls record is asked for as they will not share that with me. All I asking for is to wave those late fees as I was not at fault at all. Please guide me for the right remedy for this problem.",

I am worried about my credit score and can not get any answers from no Supervisors of Capital One.

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "I accepted a credit card off for the Barclays XXXX XXXX. The initial disclosure provided to me indicated a promotional rate of 0.00 APR on purchases ( 6 months ) and balance transfers ( for 15 months ). Upon receiving my card the disclosure provided did not reference the promotional rate on the balance transfers, therefore I called the company to discuss and was told the promotional was only on purchases. Therefore, I submitted a complaint through the bank 's website on XXXX/XXXX/15. After several back and forth responses and a letter received, it was still being indicated the promotional rate is only on purchases. As already expressed this is not what was initially disclosed to me and therefore this is deceptive to me as a consumer as I made a credit decision based on the initially information provided to me that appear to be false. I have provided the link below that provided the terms and conditions of the card that included the promotional rate of balance transfers. My other concern is what other deceptive practices might the bank be conducting. \n\nhttps : //www.barclaycardus.com/apply/Landing.action?

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "Complaint Against : Wells Fargo Financial National BankI was charged a {$25.00} late fee on a {$500.00} remaining balance for paying {$120.00} well ahead of the due date but not covering the full \" minimum '' payment of approximately {$190.00}. When I explained the details of the situation, they did not acknowledge the best effort I made to be current and refused to waive the fees since in their determination it was not a Wells Fargo Error. The fee is unfair, and their choice to not waive the fee was a horrible busines practice and abusive in nature as it rested on \" There is no beneift to us having to waive the fee '' Bankground Details : In XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a hot tup and took advantage of a dealer finance option that used a Wells Fargo Outdoor Solution credit card to provide XXXX months interest free financing. The total amount financed was approximately {$5500.00}. On XXXX I paid XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$2500.00} and knew there was a {$500.00} remaining balance. Given I had XXXX months interest free financing, I just diveded by XXXX and set my bill pay to send {$120.00} each month. On XXXX my XXXX {$120.00} payment was made. When I got a collection notice it showed the payment received but a late charge of {$25.00}. I immediately paid all the remaining principle of {$370.00} on XXXX and currently have a {$25.00} balance made exclusively of the fee. When I contacted Wells Fargo at XXXX they transferred me. The rep I spoke to spoke to his supervisor XXXX times about my situation and XXXX times said he could not waive the fee even after I explained the situation. When I asked to file a complaint, the rep was n't aware of anyway to file a complaint. He offered for me to speak with his supervisor. I spoke with supervisor \" XXXX '' who said she would file a payment dispute. She continued to say they would not waive the fee as Wells Fargo did n't make an error. She kept saying they send out statements and that I just need to read them. My main point of frustation and complaint is that I was paying at an accelerated rate and made a best faith attempt to not only be current but pay more than required. What I failed to realize, is even though the account has credit card access they based the minumum payment on 3.5 % of the ORIGINAL balance. My accelerated payments did n't do anything to change the minimum on what I thought was a credit card account. Because I planned out my payment strategy up front, I did n't look at the billing as they came and did n't realize their unusual therefore to a small extent deceptive minimum payment process. When I asked how frequently they get these issues, they would not answer, which makes me think it is fairly common. I sincerely believe there is an ongoing business practice to extract fees from otherwise interest free accounts without regard to customer concern or reasonable waiver policies. They went as far to partially blame current regulatory environment for not allowing discretionary waivers. My hope with this complaint is to get the {$25.00} fee waived if possible, but more importantly to ensure Wells Fargo Financial National Bank is required to have a better complaint program than they seem to. They only took the billing dispute when I made them and did not know about any complaint program. Then to make matters worse the billing dispute can take XXXX days - my balance would have been paid off for over XXXX days by that point. They do n't need 60 days.",

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "I applied for a Sam 's Club credit card at the XXXX Sam 's Club in XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and was approved for a {$10000.00} limit at 14.99 %. However I had a credit fraud alert on my credit reports which I had placed on XXXX XXXX something ( I had unauthorized charges made to a XXXX XXXX credit card for XXXX purchases in XXXX, XXXX ). \n\nI have just purchased a house in XXXX XXXX, XXXX but I was still using my old address as well since I had not moved to XXXX yet. Since I did not specify a \" contact number '' on the credit alert, Syncrony/Sam 's Club wanted to speak to me first and they did at the XXXX Sam 's Club when the Customer Service representative called them and allowed them to speak to me. I asked for the card to be sent to my XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX address as I was still residing there and was flying back in 3 days to pack my belongings. \n\nI never received a card in the next 15 days or so, and when I went back to XXXX, I asked the same Customer Service representative as to what was going on with my Sam 's Club card. She called Synchrony Bank and was told that the card was on hold and that they wanted to verify my address, and we asked them to have the card send to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX address as I had moved there from XXXX by then. Meanwhile while waiting for her to speak to the Synchrony reps, I wanted to check my Sam 's Club store credit balance, and it turns out that my account was gone. \n\nThe Sam 's Club representative had to speak to XXXX separate representatives as the first XXXX had no idea what was going on. I have been using the same login information for over 10 years, and when I did pass the login page, I used to be put to a page which asked me to choose from the XXXX accounts that I had ( XXXX was an old account which was canceled about 5 years ago, and the second XXXX was my current account ). After whatever they did, I could see the old account but I could not see the new XXXX. The Sam 's Club Customer Service representative also found out from the XXXX Synchrony Bank representative that my new XXXX was never sent to me and being processed, it showed as having been opened on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and then forgotten at the \" processing '' step of whatever they do before they issue the card. It turns out that XXXX of the previous reps she had spoken to earlier ( XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX ) to find out what was going on with my card had CLOSED the XXXX and also had deleted my existing \" Sam 's Club store card '' from my accounts. leaving me only with the closed account from 5 years ago. \n\nThe XXXX person she spoke to informed us of what happened and helped me re-register my store card online. However now, I ca n't use the user name that I had been using for the past 10 years, and had to choose a new name and I really am not pleased with that as I do n't like to randomly make up new account names for something that I have already been using for years. \n\nAnyway, he also said that XXXX of the representatives had closed my card, and after apologizing multiple times, he told me to re-apply again and that it would be processed correctly and then sent to my current address. \n\nSo I came back to XXXX again to move the last of my belongings ( I have no phone signal or internet access where I live in XXXX ), and as soon as I got internet access, I went ahead and applied for a card again online. After finishing the application process, it gave me a message about being contacted in a few days and that was it. \n\nToday, I got the following message : '' The request was judgmentally reviewed and denied for the following reason ( s ) : PRIOR APPLICATION SUBMITTED TOO RECENTLY '' I have impeccable credit with NEVER a single late or missed payment, and I was already approved for it. \n\nI am considering taking this matter to court at this time.",

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "The US Air ( ways ) and XXXX XXXX merger has created many problems for me as a credit card holder. I have been issued about XXXX different card numbers because of the merger, and supposedly there will be at least XXXX more. At the merger, each card number changes, the prior account is no longer available, and it creates a lot of problems for direct billings that the card holder has and is expected to notify those companies that direct bill with each card change. This is not an easy task, and who knows what happens to a credit score during this process, and changing the credit card is very time consuming both for the card holder and the business and seems to significantly interfere with the time, responsibilities, and work for each since most account changes need to be made between XXXX - XXXX, M - F. \nThe most annoying change has been with Barclays, XXXX, and how many of the rules have changed in terms of cut off time to pay which is now XXXX Eastern ( I live in Central Time Zone ), and how likely they are to assess late fees and finance charges beyond XXXX of the day the bill was due. The cut off time is totally ridiculous when the credit card company is held by a XXXX and presumably is a national credit card. The prior US Airways credit card had a lot more leeway without being assessed late fees and interest rates, and easy and fair removal of the late fees and charges. The XXXX card change after the merger was a XXXX XXXX XXXX card which looked exactly like the prior XXXX XXXX XXXX card, except had a new account number, but all of the additional printing on the card seemed to be the same. Was this change essential?? It did n't appear to be. \nBarclays also has on the recording when phoning in to access the account they request the account holder to provide the FULL social security number or the FULL credit card number. This seems to be outrageous ; under XXXX XXXX XXXX we had to provide the last XXXX or XXXX digits of the credit card number AND the zip code. The request that Barclay makes seems to be ripe for issues of identity theft, then you must provide additional private information when you speak to an associate. I think the request for the full social security number or full credit card number is excessive, especially when they also ask for the zip code for the billing address. It is possible that the security system was designed by programmers in the XXXX ( sp ), where this information is likely not considered protected and private information. Supposedly there will be yet another credit card change, which initially was going to be ANOTHER card within 6 weeks of the card that was required to be used by XXXX XXXX ( or so ) from Barclays! The merger has created lots of extra work for credit card holders, and providing too much information via phone that can lead to customer fraud and identity theft.",

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "This dispute centers around credit card debt which I incurred beginning in XXXX XXXX and which Bank of America ( BofA ) charged off in XXXX XXXX. Following charge-off I continued to repay the principle amount outstanding until it was fully satisfied in XXXX XXXX. Subsequently I discovered that BofA had unlawfully assessed interest and fees of at least {$15000.00} to my account post charge-off. I have requested repayment from BofA which has been denied. Even by BofA 's own accounting I have overpaid the bank by {$510.00} which has yet to be returned to me despite the company 's statement in the attached letter that I would receive a refund in \" seven to ten business days ''. Attached are all the relevant documents which I have been able to find. Curiously BofA has been unable to supply any proof of a debt. \nBy way of background, since I initially believed the collection agents owned the debt in question I filed a complaint with the CFPB against those agencies ( Case Number : XXXX ). However, through that process I discovered that despite being told otherwise for years, BofA had in fact never sold the debt. It is through this complaint that I am requesting to be repaid by BofA either the entire {$45000.00} collected until such time as BofA can verify exactly what is owed, or in the alternative I am asking for the {$15000.00} in interest and fees which I believe were illegally assessed to my account. \nAfter completing graduate school in XXXX and following the tech crisis and tragic events of XXXX XXXX I was unable to find continuous work for a period of years. Debt laden and without work, I fell behind on my credit card payments and eventually my account went into charge-off status in XXXX. Over the ensuing years the account was transferred to a number of collection agencies including XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX and XXXX. At all times I fully intended to repay the debt as soon as I was employed. In fact, I began repaying the collection agencies in XXXX and continued these monthly payments until I had satisfied the amounts allegedly due in XXXX. Throughout that time I repeatedly asked BofA 's agents to confirm the amounts owed and the legal owner of the debt. I was uniformly told that BofA had transferred the debt and that no fees or interest had been charged to the account post charge-off. However, no proof could be supplied. Believing I had no recourse I continued to make payments until the full amount requested had been satisfied. \nIn XXXX, while cleaning out old papers I found a statement from XXXX XXXX which I had somehow previously overlooked. The statement clearly shows that interest and fees had been assessed to my account post charge-off. The statement attached to this complaint shows attorney 's fees of {$6000.00} and interest of {$9500.00} all of which was assessed to my account after it was charged off. \nHowever, despite being assessed these fees I never received a statement from BofA showing fees or interest being added to the principle due. In fact, post charge-off BofA stopped sending any statements to me. Importantly this fact is not in dispute. BofA admits it charged interest and fees to my account but amazingly can not tell me how much. Furthermore, in conversations with its representative XXXX XXXX, BofA acknowledges that it stopped sending statements once the account was charged off. As such, under the Truth in Lending Act BofA had no right to assess these amounts to my account and should be forced to return them. \nSince I can only demonstrate that {$15000.00} of interest and fees were assessed I am asking for that amount to be returned immediately. However, since BofA can not verify the debt in any fashion I would also ask that they return the entire {$45000.00} paid to them until such time as they can demonstrate exactly what is owed.",

I was informed that BOA was making changes to their Online Banking system and that I need not worry and my {$99.00} payment on XXXX/XXXX/15 will be applied to the XXXX/XXXX/15 due date. \n\nOn XXXX/XXXX/15, I noticed that my account was past due, there was a new payment due immediately for {$98.00}, a {$25.00} late fee for payment due, my card was blocked from use and my credit line was decreased from {$10000.00} to {$8900.00}, as a result of this \" delinquency. '' All of these penalties occurred without reason and prior notification to me. \n\nOn XXXX/XXXX/15, I contacted BOA via chat and telephone and after research, it was discovered that it was bank error that my payment for the XXXX/XXXX/15 due date was incorrectly applied in the system and therefore, I received a {$25.00} late charge adjustment. I was then informed that this matter would be immediately rectified and the new payment due immediately for {$98.00} would zero out and I would only have to pay the XXXX/XXXX/15 amount due of {$120.00}. \n\nOn XXXX/XXXX/15, I noticed that my account was still past due, and now I owed an amount of {$220.00} by XXXX/XXXX/15 ( $ 98+ {$120.00} for XXXX ). I contacted BOA again via chat and telephone and again, was advised this would again be immediately rectified. Not trusting BOA after false information was previously provided to me, I paid both the {$98.00} and the {$120.00} to have my account placed back in good standing, even though it was in good standing and always has been. \n\nOn XXXX/XXXX/15, I contacted BOA via chat and telephone and inquired again as to why this has n't been rectified and more importantly, to request my previous credit line of {$10000.00} be RESTORED, since the reduction was a result of BOA incorrectly putting my account in delinquency. I was advised that would be impossible without running a new credit report and I declined. I DID NOT REQUEST an INCREASE in my credit line, I requested my credit line be RESTORED, due to BOA 's error. \n\nNot only did BOA misapply my payment, I had to pay a new payment due immediately for {$98.00}, a {$25.00} late fee for payment due, which was later refunded, my card was blocked from use and my credit line was decreased from {$10000.00} to {$8900.00}, and the refusal to RESTORE it, as a result of BOA 's error, is appalling.",

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "On Monday XXXX XXXX between XXXX & XXXX PST, I contacted my Sears credit card to inquire about a charge and a renewed credit card. I spoke to a representative who could do nothing but apologize about not being able to help me. That CSR could not access my account for some unexplainable reason. Suddenly, I was transferred to another CSR in XXXX. That representative immediately asked for my \" personal password. '' I was confused by this because they are not allowed to ask for my personal password. They 're supposed to identify me by asking for the answer to certain secret questions, which I previously set up. When I inquired about why they were asking for my \" personal password '' I was told that was the way it is. I was feeling suspicious of who I was speaking with after the transfer and believed it to not be Sears Credit Card services at all. Too many hackers and identity thief 's are out there today and after this experience I decided something was wrong. I then ask to speak to a manager, more precisely, someone higher up. The manager whose name was XXXX ( or XXXX ) got on the phone and was immediately defensive & borderline rude. She kept interrupting me & would not allow me to clarify the situation & basically was unhelpful. I never raised my voice or said anything inappropriate. I even asked about the language to be certain I understood what they were trying to ask of me. I thought maybe it was a matter of semantics & language. This manager would not acknowledge that to be the case, which made me feel hesitant to release any information to these \" representatives. '' In any case, XXXX refused to neither help me & clarify my concerns nor solve any issues. She was quick to let me know that everyone followed a script and they have to ask the question as it is written. I understand this to an extent, because I worked in XXXX. We had scripts, but were also taught to listen to the customers. After all, they may a reason for their questions. Not everyone calling in is out to scream, yell & lodge complaints. That was not the purpose of my call. All I wanted was clarification about the personal password request & conduct my business accordingly. I did not get to conduct my business. I did not get answers to the questions I had. All I was told by this manager was that that 's the way it was ; reading the script verbatim and asking for customer 's personal passwords. In my opinion, this was utterly ludicrous. This is exactly how identity theft begins. I realized XXXX was not going to assist in any formidable way, which is a shame. I simply said thank you and have a nice day before hanging up. I was not about to get involved in a hacking situation or breach of security issue, especially not knowing for certain who I was actually speaking with. I wanted to report this because I do not believe I was represented well by Sears 's Credit Cards services. And I do not want to see other people have their personal account information compromised toward the possibility of identity theft. These representatives forgot that they are a consumer as well & they did n't provide good customer service. They did not care and put my personal account in jeopardy. In the end, I did not believe I was talking to the credit card company and if I was talking to the credit card company then they should probably go back and review that call center location in XXXX and the practices they have written into their script, which promotes jeopardizing customer accounts. What concerns me is that Sears did not protect me or was concerned with my personal security at all & it brings to question things such as a lack of professionalism, identity theft & good customer service. I also seriously question their business ethics & will consider changing my services.",

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "I received a Synchrony Bank Credit Card in XXXX, and signed up to pay online from my checking account at another bank. I do this with all of my credit cards, and have been doing it for at least five years -- without any problem. \nI thought I made an online payment on XXXX XXXX ( due date was XXXX XXXX ), and received an acknowledgement email, which I did n't look at too closely. When I got an email today that said I had not paid yet, I looked at the acknowledgement email, and saw that it had *scheduled my payment for the due date. * I would never do this purposely, and when I went online to see the scheduled transaction, I saw that it defaults automatically to the due date, not the date posted ( or the next day ). To make sure that this was not something I had done, I cancelled the payment and then clicked the \" Make a Payment '' again. The page I am attaching is a picture of the Payment Page on the webpage that shows the default payment date ( the due date ) and the note the bank includes about what happens when payments are made on the due date. \nI believe that this is a deceptive practice, and that the bank should not be allowed to keep this practice.

They refuse to respond in writing, and only respond via online secure messaging trying to get me to call in.

If CFPB fails to appropriately address this matter, and instead, simply sends me Capital One 's response, then considers the matter closed, I will report this to my Congressman, as well as post it on the Internet, as clearly, that indicates CFPB is just a \" dummy '' agency created for the sole purpose of keeping the OCC from having to handle consumer complaints.",

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "Home Depot pushed their credit card on me when I bought a refrigerator from them, stating that it would be interest-free for six months. By the end of that introductory period, I had paid the initial charge of {$2400.00} down to a remaining balance of {$340.00}. On that statement, I was charged {$130.00} in interest. When I called home depot to inquire about it, I was told that it was interest-free for first XXXX months but after that interest would be charged on the entire initial amount of {$2400.00}. In other words, they were forcing me to pay interest on approx {$2100.00} that I had previously paid off before the end of the introductory offer. I can not believe that this is legal and think Home Depot is fleecing their customers. Please advise if this practice is in fact legal and what I can do about it. Thanks",

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "We had a Zions First National Bank credit card, opened in XX/XX/XXXX. We made all payments on time, never late. We stopped using the card but kept the card open. \nIn XX/XX/XXXX we moved from XXXX to XXXX. \nThe card has an annual fee which was always paid on time when billed. Because of the move we did not receive the bill and the issuer added late charges and fees to the annual fee. They never called either me or my husband to let us know we had a balance and to collect, we are both over XXXX and this should have been a factor. \nWhen I finally received the bill 3 months later forwarded from my old address I called Zions. I paid the entire amount including fees and late charges ( {$25.00} annual fee with late charges totaled {$75.00} ) and they said they would pull the negative credit reporting. I also closed the account due to their obvious lack of valuing us as a customer and lack of customer service. \nThe issue today is that the negative 30 day late is still on our credit reports. They reported it as closed by credit grantor which is inaccurate because we requested it be closed, It is the only negative item but it affects our overall credit score. \nI 've called Zions bank XXXX times and they request that I send a letter explaining what happened each time. I do n't know what they do with the letters because they should have them in triplicate at this point. \nDue to our ages and previous payment history the fact they never called to find out why we had n't paid an annual fee but instead adding late charges to it, borders on elder abuse, and I feel it should be reported.",

Along with the stress of low income i had a sister sick with XXXX, a mother suffering with what could posablly be XXXX, and a mother in law who is both physicaly and mentally XXXX who also lived XXXX to XXXX hours away depending on traffic who needs us up there quite often not to mention my husbands an only child. I also work full time in a very demanding job with an equally demanding boss so between my streeful job and personnel life i was finding it difficult to keep up and remember absolutely everything and knowing at the time I was only able to afford to make the minimum payment on both credit card accounts i took the initiative to call capital one and set it up to were they just automatically took out the minimum due out each month on the credit cards until I could afford to do otherwise. A few months later I reseved a letter in the mail from capital one stating that I had not paid on my accounts in months and they were about to close me out. In shock and upset I called capital one only to find out that they had already closed out both of my accounts. I tried to explain to them that I had spoken to XXXX of there represenitives and had my payments set up to be automatically taken out of my bank account each month that there must have been a horable mistake made all I got from them was my accounts have been closed out and that there was Absolutely nothing they or I could do to reopen them and nothing they could do to help me. Devistated and in tears I tried to look online for other capital one departments to call for some help with my situation but no matter what department I tried to call it always just took me back to the original department that I first talk to who refused to help me. At this point in time I have paid XXXX account off in full and current stuck making payments to an account that I ca n't no longer use and my credit score that I have worked so hard to rebuild has been greatly effected all because capital one a company who I have been a loyal customer and until this payment arrangement screw up I have always paid on time to on both credit card accounts since I got them 2 years ago refused to help or even hear me out. I will take fault in the fact that I should have paid better attention to my bank statements and made sure the money was being taken out as arranged but I do n't feel that I deserve to have both of my accounts closed out and my credit that I was working so hard to rebuild ruined over an unfortunate misunderstanding. I was n't even given the chance to plead my case even though it was there company 's screw up and did n't follow threw with our payment arrangement. I would like to have the chance to be heard and have the possibility of having my accounts reopend and to not have all my hard work be for nothing I think that 's the part that bothers me the most. At this point I feel hopeless that I will get any cooperation from capital one and pray that you can help me.",

Since my wife works for an airline I told him we did n't need it for our personal use but would be interested if we could use it for these trips. He assured us it could. As our documentation shows, we were given promises that did not materialize. So i began to call and complain, and demanding a refund and being told it was beyond the 3 days allowed by law - rudely at that - I finally took them to small claims court in XXXX, XXXX, and won a judgment. Since this company is a 'scam ' and knows how to work the system, they have multiple offices in XXXX , XXXX , and XXXX that i know of. Trying to get a physical address and trying to collect is nearly impossible. So I asked Visa to reverse the charges. I have my Visa through Arvest Bank, which uses Security Bankcard Center. Initially they reversed the charges ( Arvest did ) but then they called and said Visa will not reverse them since I had a judgment and might collect double payment so I needed to pursue through the courts. Per my attorney i was told to press Visa to reverse the charge. They refused saying it was past the 'statute of limitations ' of when the charge was made. The travel co. would n't refund and cancel because they said it was past the 3 days, yet it was during that first week I was trying to use their services before finding out the empty promises.

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "On XXXX XXXX, 2015 a cease and desist demand was sent ( certified mail with return receipt XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to Capital One in reference to consumers account ( s ) ending in XXXX & XXXX. Consumer specified consumers wish to have the accounts closed and noted as 'Accounts closed by consumer ' on consumers credit report. Consumer warned Capital One that consumer would check on consumers report within thirty ( 30 ) days from the date of notice to make sure Capital One had honored consumers request. Consumer received letters from Capital One dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 stating Capital One had applied a 'Cease & Desist ' to the account ( s ) which meant they would no longer contact consumer and stated that the cease & desist does not impact any payment plans, arrangements previously arranged with Capital One which leads the consumer to believe the account ( s ) have not been closed and noted as requested by consumer. Consumer requested knowledge that the accounts reflect closed by consumer under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( \" FCRA '' ) 15. U.S.C. Sections 1681u - 1681v. Consumer informed ( and warned ) Capital One that if they did not comply consumer would file a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and ask complaint be forwarded to governing entities. A copy of the cease & desist document is attached to this complaint as proof positive request to Capital One and warning of consumer 's intent if Capital One did not honor consumers request under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( \" FCRA '' ). At this time Capital One is in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681-1681u ( \" FCRA '' ) by misuse and misreporting the credit information provided by the consumer. Capital One furnishes information to consumer reporting agencies and is subject to Section 623 of the FCRA 15 U.S.C. Section 1681 s-2 which imposes a series of duties and prohibitions upon any person or entity that furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency. Reporting accounts as active when voluntarily closed by consumer and misstating the balance due is a violation of the FCRA. Consumer has the right to request consumer 's account reflect consumers wish to close the account by consumer on credit report. Capital One was told ( in writing ) that consumer intended to file a federal lawsuit if ANY negative information is placed on consumers credit report other than 'Account closed by Consumer '.",

During my entire membership with Discover, I was never late with payments, and always stayed under my credit line, and never charged my credit card for any purposes other than making a legitimate purchase. \n\nAbout a month ago, without any notice in advance, Discover closed my account and thereby wiped out my existing cashback rewards of {$300.00}.

    "Consumer complaint narrative": "I sent the below letter to Bank of America for a resolution, which they denied. I believe their actions are unjust. \n\nI am writing you with a very heavy heart. I am extremely dishearten and dissatisfied with the level of insensitivity and lack of understanding and communications received from Bank of America 's representatives regarding my closed account, now \" charged off ''. I am requesting the charge off be reversed due to miscommunications and technicality. In XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a representative, who I notified that I was having hardship ( became unemployed ). She notified me that my account would be charged off on XX/XX/XXXX. Being XX/XX/XXXX was on a Saturday ( weekend ). I paid the bill on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, which was paid the next business day, XX/XX/XXXX. I had no idea my account would be charged off on a weekend and neither was I explained this information in detailed. \n\nAdditional information : I also was told that I had a cease and desist order on my account, which too was puzzling. I never requested a cease and desist and was never told such an order would be put on my account when requesting not to contacted via telephone. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, the represented mentioned that the cease and desist stopped all phone calls and correspondence, which I would have never agreed to. Requesting not to receive phone calls is totally different then not receiving mail. I never knew there was an issue until now, because I was still receiving my monthly statements. Therefore, I did n't get any reminder notice for the upcoming charge off or notice of the actual charge off or any notice pertaining to this cease and desist order that I did not consent to. \n\nI have had several hardships during the course of this account from being unemployment several times, XXXX, newborn ( a bundle of joy, nevertheless a financial adversity ), accepting a XXXX \" only '' XXXX position, which was insufficient, thus having to move in with my mother, then recently in XX/XX/XXXX, becoming unemployed again. Through it all, I did the best I could. Now, that I have almost completed my payment in full, it is quite unfair and disappointing to receive a charge-off on my account for a difference of XXXX days, of which XXXX were weekend days. Furthermore, I never receive any notification pertaining to this charge-off, due to the above mentioned unauthorized communications disconnect. I thought Bank of America was in the business of helping people and that Bank of America would much rather see me pay my bill and build up my credit vs. damage my credit with a derogatory \" charge-off ''. \n\nI am asking that you have compassion, thereby reversing the charge-off on the aforementioned account, in so doing allowing me to pay my outstanding balance in the amount of {$1200.00} without such a steep penalty. I really like Bank of America and hope to be a customer again, when my financial situation changes for the better. \n\nThank you kindly for your consideration, time and immediate attention to this matter.

The next person I talked to gave me more information about the account ( meaning the other person lied about no other information being available ) and told me that a SOL did not matter with their company. I told her that was inaccurate and that the FTC states one can not be sued for debt out side that SOL. She claimed that was innacurate information and they were a private entity. I asked her if her company was above the FTC. She said no but that info was wrong. Furthermore, she told me the account had been closed by the previous rep but she would reopen again it due to my verbal complaint which sounded like a threat!

I am separated from my wife and she set up payments to automatically come out of her bank account. For some reason after 6 months they quit taking the payments. Due to our situation there was a lack of communication and we did n't realize for several months that this had occured. After a while I came in contact with Synchrony bank to begin trying to rectify the situation. They have never been very helpful or courteous to me throughout this ordeal. They told me once that they could put me on a program to help me out. But I was going to have to suspend charging privileges. I did n't want to do that so I called Dicks to try and find a better solution. They referred me back to Synchrony. When I called them back to take their offer 15 minutes later, they informed me that I had no programs available to help me. So anyway, I have been paying the minimum payments to try and get the past due amount taken care of. My charging privileges have been suspended. That is all well and good, but what I 'm filing my complaint about is that last month, and maybe other months, I made my payment on time and they still charged me a late fee. When I called to make my XXXX payment I questioned them and they said that since I did n't pay the full amount that I would get charged late fees. I think that is absurd.
